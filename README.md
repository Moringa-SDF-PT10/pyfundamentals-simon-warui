Returns the sum of two numbers.

2. ## is_even(number)
Returns True if the number is even, False otherwise.

3. ## reverse_string(text)
Returns the reversed version of a given string.

4. ## count_vowels(text)
Counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input string. Case-insensitive.

5. ## calculate_factorial(n)
Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer n.

6. ## apply_decorator(func)
Applies a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the given function.

7. ## sort_by_age(people)
Takes a list of tuples with names and ages, and returns the list sorted by age in ascending order.

8. ## merge_dicts(dict1, dict2)
Merges two dictionaries. If a key appears in both, their values are summed.

9. ## Car class
